# PollenTracker

Created for Hack OHI/O 2021 by three seniors at Upper Arlington High School: JC Yan, Ben Underwood and Emma Wang.

We built an app that uses the community as a whole to track large movements of pollen by educating people about how to identify common allergens and providing a platform to post their locations so we can model pollen movement according to wind patterns. This app provides an opportunity for people to take allergy medications ahead of time or to steer clear of the area altogether. 

We used Android Studio to program the app, UXPin to prototype, MapBox API to visualize the data, MySQL to store data, and we can use the R programming language to make deeper connections in our data.

Hopefully, this app will move to production in the near future.
